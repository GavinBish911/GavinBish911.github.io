## Overview
Originally, this application supported only minimal lookups using unique identifiers. With Enhancement 1, the system now allows comprehensive searches by various criteria (e.g., name, date, time, phone number, and email). Additionally, we expanded the patient data model to include insurance information, contact details, and other relevant fields, resulting in a more reliable and complete patient record.

**Primary Objectives:**
- Introduce a flexible, robust search functionality for appointments.
- Enhance the patient data model with new fields (e.g., insurance info, phone number).
- Streamline data entry and retrieval for improved user experience.

## Key Features

1. **Flexible Search Parameters**  
   - Users can now look up appointments by name, date, time, phone number, email address, and more.
   - This significantly reduces the time spent manually browsing through limited search results.

2. **Extended Patient Data Model**  
   - Added new attributes such as insurance information, contact details, and other relevant medical data.
   - Ensures a more comprehensive view of each patient’s profile within the system.

3. **Improved User Experience**  
   - Enhanced interface for scheduling and reviewing appointment details.
   - Clear, organized forms and search fields make data entry and retrieval easier for administrative or medical staff.

4. **Separation of Concerns**  
   - Back-end logic handling search and retrieval is abstracted from the front-end presentation.
   - The codebase is now more modular, making future enhancements and maintenance smoother.
