## Introduction

Welcome to my professional portfolio. My name is **Gavin Bish**, and I am a Computer Science graduate with a strong focus on software engineering, system design, and full-stack development. This GitHub Pages site serves as a curated showcase of my academic work, technical growth, and applied problem-solving throughout my undergraduate program at Southern New Hampshire University.

This portfolio represents the culmination of my **CS-499 Capstone** and highlights the evolution of my skills across software architecture, data management, testing, and secure system design. Each artifact included here reflects deliberate iteration, technical refinement, and adherence to industry best practices. My goal is to demonstrate not only what I built, but *how* and *why* I built it—emphasizing maintainability, scalability, and thoughtful engineering decisions.

## Professional Self-Assessment

Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in software engineering principles, system architecture, and secure development practices. My coursework and applied projects have strengthened my ability to design maintainable systems, write clean and testable code, and approach problem-solving with a structured and analytical mindset.

A significant part of my growth has come from refining how I evaluate my own work. Rather than focusing solely on implementation, I have learned to assess performance, scalability, and long-term maintainability. This shift has influenced how I approach software design—placing greater emphasis on documentation, modularity, and future extensibility.

Although much of my academic work was completed independently, I consistently approached each project as if it were part of a collaborative development environment. This meant writing readable code, anticipating future contributors, and considering real-world user and stakeholder needs. Through this process, I strengthened my ability to communicate technical decisions clearly and to align software solutions with practical objectives.

Together, the projects presented here demonstrate my readiness to contribute meaningfully to professional software development teams and to continue growing as an engineer committed to quality, reliability, and continuous learning.

## Personal Code Review

To complement the written artifacts in this portfolio, I recorded a personal code review discussing my development process, architectural decisions, and lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle.

This review provides insight into how my coding practices evolved over time, the challenges I encountered, and the improvements I made to enhance maintainability, readability, and overall system design.

## Project: Grand Strand Systems

For the first major enhancement, I focused on expanding and refining an existing appointment management system. The original implementation supported only limited record lookup functionality. To improve usability and realism, I redesigned the system to support flexible search capabilities across multiple attributes, including patient name, appointment date, contact information, and identifiers.

In addition, I expanded the underlying data model to include richer patient records such as insurance details, contact metadata, and extended demographic information. These enhancements significantly improved data organization and usability, transforming the application into a more scalable and practical solution suitable for real-world clinical or administrative environments.

## Project: Unit Testing Enhancements

The second enhancement focused on improving software reliability through comprehensive unit testing and algorithmic validation. Prior to this phase, the system lacked sufficient automated test coverage, increasing the risk of regressions and undetected defects.

I designed and implemented structured unit tests covering core logic, data handling routines, and edge cases. In parallel, I reviewed existing algorithms to ensure efficiency, clarity, and correctness. This process not only improved system stability but also reinforced best practices for test-driven development and long-term maintainability.

## Project: CRUD Operations

The third enhancement focused on strengthening the system’s data persistence layer. While basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations were already functional, I refined these processes to improve performance, reliability, and data integrity.

Key improvements included optimized query logic, stronger validation mechanisms, and better handling of concurrent access scenarios. I also refined the underlying schema to better support scalability and future feature expansion. These updates ensure the system can reliably manage growing datasets while maintaining consistency and accuracy.
