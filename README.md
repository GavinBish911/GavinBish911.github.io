## Overview

Prior to this update, the system had limited testing coverage, making it difficult to guarantee that new features did not introduce regressions. Additionally, certain data-processing algorithms were due for optimization to improve performance and readability. This enhancement provides an extensive suite of unit tests, focuses on algorithmic refinements in scheduling and data handling, and improves overall code clarity.

**Primary Objectives:**
- Achieve thorough unit testing coverage across all core modules.
- Streamline algorithms for handling appointments, data queries, and concurrency scenarios.
- Enhance readability and maintainability of the codebase.

## Usage

1. Login and Registration
   - Log in as an administrator or staff member using your credentials.
   - If new, create an account or request one from an existing administrator.

2. Search Appointments
   - Use the new search bar or advanced filter interface to look up appointments based on various criteria such as date, time, patient name, phone number, or email.
   - Results are displayed in real-time, enabling quick identification and management of relevant appointments.

3. View or Edit Patient Information
   - Access extended patient profiles, which now include fields such as insurance details and multiple contact points.
   - Update or correct patient information directly in the system, ensuring accuracy and completeness.

4. Reporting and Logs
   - Administrators can generate simplified logs or reports that detail appointment searches or updates, aiding in auditing and compliance.
