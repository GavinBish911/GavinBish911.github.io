## Introduction
Hello, my name is Gavin Bish, and I have been pursuing a Computer Science degree at SNHU for the past two years. This GitHub Pages account serves as an electronic portfolio to showcase my work and chronicle the progress of my final project for CS-499. Completing this capstone project will mark the end of an important chapter in my academic journey, culminating in the achievement of my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. Through this portfolio, I aim to demonstrate the skills and knowledge I have gained during my studies, and I look forward to applying these skills to future opportunities and challenges.

## Professional Self Assessment
Over the course of my studies in the Computer Science program, I have honed my technical skills and learned how to present my work in ways that reflect my professional goals, values, and growth. Developing my ePortfolio has been a pivotal experience in showcasing my strengths and demonstrating my readiness to enter—or advance within—the field. Through ongoing coursework, I have learned to use best practices for efficiency and maintainability, refined my problem-solving approach with data structures and algorithms, and further understood the fundamentals of software engineering, databases, and security. Each step in my academic journey has been an opportunity to improve the quality of my code and to more effectively communicate the thought process behind my solutions.

Although my work has largely been conducted independently, I have gained a deep appreciation for collaboration and stakeholder communication as cornerstones of professional success. Even when not in a formal team environment, I found value in inviting informal feedback and applying a rigorous self-review process to maintain objectivity. By imagining and respecting future stakeholder perspectives, I was able to design software solutions that prioritize clarity, user experience, and scalability. Moreover, integrating secure coding practices has prepared me to handle sensitive information responsibly, reflecting the broader ethical considerations of real-world computer science projects.

These ePortfolio artifacts collectively represent the evolution of my expertise and illustrate how I have grown to approach tasks with a more strategic, security-conscious, and user-focused mindset. Each project has been revisited and refined to better align with the standards and best practices I have acquired throughout the program. By curating these artifacts in one cohesive collection, I aim to convey my technical abilities, my commitment to continuous improvement, and my capacity to adapt in the ever-changing landscape of computer science.

## Projects

### Project Grand Strand Systems
-For this first enhancement, I focused on significantly improving the existing appointment scheduling system by adding more robust search capabilities and extending patient information fields. Originally, the application only supported minimal lookups based on unique identifiers. In this enhancement, I introduced flexible search parameters that let users find appointments or patient records by name, date, time, phone number, email address, and more. This change drastically improves the efficiency and user experience when managing multiple appointments.

Additionally, I updated the patient data model to include important fields such as insurance information, contact details, and other key attributes. This improvement ensures that users can maintain a comprehensive patient record while streamlining the flow of information. Overall, Enhancement 1 transforms the system into a more practical and user-friendly platform that better serves medical or administrative staff looking to organize and retrieve appointment and patient data quickly.

### Project Unit Testing
-For the second enhancement, I focused on strengthening the reliability and maintainability of the system through comprehensive unit testing and algorithmic refinements. Prior to this effort, the application only had basic or minimal coverage, making it difficult to ensure that newly added features worked correctly or that existing features remained stable. By introducing a robust suite of tests for all critical functions and data-handling routines, I significantly boosted code confidence.

This enhancement also included revisiting core algorithms used throughout the project—particularly those handling data processing, lookups, and scheduling logic—to confirm efficiency and accuracy. In the process, I refactored segments that could benefit from improved data structures or logic flow, which further optimized performance. Ultimately, Enhancement 2 ensures that updates and future expansions can be integrated seamlessly, reducing the likelihood of regressions while helping maintain a high-quality codebase.

### Project CRUD Operations
-For the third enhancement, I turned my attention to strengthening the system’s database layer. While the application already supported basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) methods, this enhancement refined those operations to improve efficiency, data integrity, and security. Specifically, I introduced optimized queries and indexing to handle large data sets more effectively, reducing query times and enhancing overall performance. Additionally, I implemented concurrency checks to prevent conflicts when multiple users access or modify the database simultaneously.

This enhancement also included refining the schema to accommodate more robust data relationships and employing best practices for data validation at the database level. These measures collectively ensure that the application can scale and maintain consistent, accurate records. As a result, Enhancement 3 provides a more dependable and high-performing data foundation for any future features, further solidifying the overall reliability and professionalism of the project.
