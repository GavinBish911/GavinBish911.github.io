## Introduction
Hello, my name is Gavin Bish, and I have been pursuing a Computer Science degree at SNHU for the past two years. This GitHub Pages account serves as an electronic portfolio to showcase my work and chronicle the progress of my final project for CS-499. Completing this capstone project will mark the end of an important chapter in my academic journey, culminating in the achievement of my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. Through this portfolio, I aim to demonstrate the skills and knowledge I have gained during my studies, and I look forward to applying these skills to future opportunities and challenges.

## Education Review
Completing my coursework for this class has heightened my appreciation for the importance of thoroughly reviewing and refining one’s work in a professional manner. This review process often involves rewriting unnecessarily complex code, adding clear comments, and expanding a program’s functionality. Over the duration of the course, I have improved my artifacts by incorporating secure coding testing modules, adding new database CRUD functions, and introducing more complex list search capabilities for an appointment scheduler.

Working within a team environment has also underscored the value of having a fresh perspective on my work. It is easy to become so immersed in a project that it becomes difficult to objectively evaluate one’s own code. Another set of eyes can reveal overlooked errors and offer constructive feedback for improvements. Furthermore, focusing on stakeholder communication to determine project requirements has been a key element of my efforts in this class. This experience has reinforced my belief that the most crucial stage of the software development lifecycle is the requirements-gathering phase, during which stakeholders, developers, project leads, and end users collaborate to shape the project’s direction.

## Personal Code Review
-This is my own personal [video](https://youtu.be/xJKR-Wp14V0) on my code reviewing how I have grown, likes, and dislikes about my old systems.

## Projects

### Project Grand Strand Systems
-For this first enhancement, I focused on significantly improving the existing appointment scheduling system by adding more robust search capabilities and extending patient information fields. Originally, the application only supported minimal lookups based on unique identifiers. In this enhancement, I introduced flexible search parameters that let users find appointments or patient records by name, date, time, phone number, email address, and more. This change drastically improves the efficiency and user experience when managing multiple appointments.

Additionally, I updated the patient data model to include important fields such as insurance information, contact details, and other key attributes. This improvement ensures that users can maintain a comprehensive patient record while streamlining the flow of information. Overall, Enhancement 1 transforms the system into a more practical and user-friendly platform that better serves medical or administrative staff looking to organize and retrieve appointment and patient data quickly.

### Project Unit Testing
-For the second enhancement, I focused on strengthening the reliability and maintainability of the system through comprehensive unit testing and algorithmic refinements. Prior to this effort, the application only had basic or minimal coverage, making it difficult to ensure that newly added features worked correctly or that existing features remained stable. By introducing a robust suite of tests for all critical functions and data-handling routines, I significantly boosted code confidence.

This enhancement also included revisiting core algorithms used throughout the project—particularly those handling data processing, lookups, and scheduling logic—to confirm efficiency and accuracy. In the process, I refactored segments that could benefit from improved data structures or logic flow, which further optimized performance. Ultimately, Enhancement 2 ensures that updates and future expansions can be integrated seamlessly, reducing the likelihood of regressions while helping maintain a high-quality codebase.

### Project CRUD Operations
-For the third enhancement, I turned my attention to strengthening the system’s database layer. While the application already supported basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) methods, this enhancement refined those operations to improve efficiency, data integrity, and security. Specifically, I introduced optimized queries and indexing to handle large data sets more effectively, reducing query times and enhancing overall performance. Additionally, I implemented concurrency checks to prevent conflicts when multiple users access or modify the database simultaneously.

This enhancement also included refining the schema to accommodate more robust data relationships and employing best practices for data validation at the database level. These measures collectively ensure that the application can scale and maintain consistent, accurate records. As a result, Enhancement 3 provides a more dependable and high-performing data foundation for any future features, further solidifying the overall reliability and professionalism of the project.
